# The C💯 Programming Language
Hello there!👋 We are the C💯 Committee 🙌. Our mission 🚀 is to bring the outdated C language
🥱 to the current times! 🔝 We don't believe people have to deal with its boring XX century 
text only syntax anymore 🙅‍♀️. C, while having helped the computer science field reach
heights unheard of 👏 is nowadays looking outdated, plain, and is hindering industry growth 📈
by being unappealing to potential new programmers 💀. That's why we have developed C💯! 🤘 A
new programming language that retains the power of C 💪 and doesn't bore new developers to
a screeching halt! 🤭

## How does C💯 work? 🤔
C💯 is identical to the old 👴 C, but replaces its outdated constructs with emojis! 👌🔝
You can check 🧐 the equivalencies in the **C💯 Translation Table** below:

C💯 also provides additional emojis you can use to express your opinion about
a block of code 🤭, wether you like it 😍 or not 😤. These are 🔥, 🔝, 👏, 🥱
and 😡.

## Installation 🔥
Work in progress section 😒💀🥲.

## Usage 😎
To use C💯 😻, you can write C💯 code in a text editor 💻 and save it with a `.c💯` 
extension 💾. To compile C💯 code, you can use the `c💯` compiler 🥳. To convert
existing C code to C💯 code 🥰, you can use the `c💯t` program 🤫. Both tools are
provided in this repository 😊.

### Compiling C💯 code 😮
To compile C💯 code 🤘, simply run the `c💯` compiler and provide the path to your C💯
file as an argument 🤝. For example 👀:

```
c💯 input.c💯 -o output
```

This will compile your C💯 file using the `c💯` command 🫡 and create an executable file
in the same directory as your C💯 file 🤯.

### Converting C code 😖 to C💯 code 🥵
To convert a C file 💩 to a C💯 file 🔝, simply run the `c💯t` tool and provide the
path to your C file as an argument 🫶. For example 👀:

```
c💯t my_c_file.c
```

This will create a new file called `my_c_file.c💯` 🙌 in the same directory as your
original C file 🤗.

## Example 🤓
Here's an example of a factorial 😵‍💫 program written in C 🥶 and the same program
written in C💯 👏:

The C program 😾:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    printf("%d! = %d\n", n, factorial(n));
    return 0;
}
```

And here's the same program written in C💯 😻:

``` c
🤣🥳 <stdio.h>

😉 factorial(😉 n)🔝 {
    🤔 (n 🤝 0) {
        😘 1;
    } 🤷 {
        😘 n 🙌 factorial(n 👎 1); 🔥
    }
}

😉 main() {
    😉 n 👉 5;
    printf🥱("%d! = %d\n", n, factorial(n)); 
    😘 0;
}

```
